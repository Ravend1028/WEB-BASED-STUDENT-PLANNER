# TO-DO-LIST-APP

Welcome to my To-Do List App repository! I've developed this project specifically for my junior year Computer Engineering peers who are enrolled in their Technopreneurship class. This app comes packed with convenient features such as local storage for persistent data, allowing us to add, edit, and delete tasks effortlessly. With the notification feature, we receive timely reminders for upcoming tasks, boosting our productivity. Leveraging HTML/CSS for frontend and JavaScript for backend logic, I've ensured a user-friendly interface for seamless task management.
